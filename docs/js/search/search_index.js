approach.\n\nmaster is the stable branch with tagged releases\ndevelop is the snapshot branch, it's mostly stable but active development is done on this branch.\nfeature/* are temporary, working branches that are not supposed to be stable or usable. They are deleted once merged into develop\n\nFor most uses master is the only branch to consider.\nAngular 4\nVersion 0.6.0 depends on Angular 5. It should be fine for most users, but if you want guaranteed Angular 4 compatibility you should use 0.5.X. This version will be maintained alongside mainline in the 0.5.x branch.\nInstallation\nTo install this library, run:\n$ npm install angular-vertical-timeline --saveOr:\nyarn add angular-vertical-timelineImporting\nImport VerticalTimelineModule into your Angular AppModule:\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\n\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\n\n// Import the timeline library\nimport { VerticalTimelineModule } from 'angular-vertical-timeline';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n\n    // Specify the timeline as an import\n    VerticalTimelineModule\n  ],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }Also import the stylesheet in your styles.css\n@import \"~angular-vertical-timeline/dist/vertical-timeline.css\";Usage\n\n\n  Hello Angular!\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n   Today\n  \n\n  \n  \n    Tomorrow\n  \n\nAngular 4 only\nTo bypass this bug\nin the Angular Date Pipe on Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer,\nsince version 0.4.1 you can supply a string to timeString with\nthe correct time to output in the timeline.\nIf no value is passed, then the\nregular dateValue and Date Pipe is used.\nNo need for this if your application is using Angular 5.\n  \n    Tomorrow\n  Example result:\n\nDevelopment\nTo generate all *.js, *.d.ts and *.metadata.json files in dist/ folder:\n$ npm run buildTo lint all *.ts files:\n$ npm run tslintLicense\nApache License 2.0 © TechGap Italia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\n                             Apache License\n                       Version 2.0, January 2004\n                    http://www.apache.org/licenses/   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\nDefinitions.\n\"License\" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,\nand distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.\n\"Licensor\" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by\nthe copyright owner that is granting the License.\n\"Legal Entity\" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all\nother entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common\ncontrol with that entity.
